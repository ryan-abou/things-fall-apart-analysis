          <h3 class="font-semibold">Okonkwo — defender of custom</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Okonkwo represents strict tradition. He believes the old ways must never change.
            His fear of weakness makes him reject anything new, even when it hurts his family
            and himself.

          <h3 class="font-semibold">Nwoye — pulled by a new story</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Nwoye feels trapped by harsh parts of tradition and by his father’s expectations.
            He is drawn to the missionaries because their message feels kinder and more
            comforting to him.

          <h3 class="font-semibold">Obierika — the reflective witness</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Obierika is loyal to his culture but also sees its problems. He explains how the
            clan begins to fall apart when new beliefs divide the people.

          <h3 class="font-semibold">Missionaries &amp; colonial rule</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            They introduce new religion, laws, and ways of thinking. At first many villagers
            ignore them, but soon they gain followers and split the community.

          <h4 class="font-semibold">1) Okonkwo breaks the Week of Peace</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            He uses violence during a sacred, peaceful time. This shows how he places his
            own beliefs above the community’s rules and how tradition can be broken from within.
          </p>

        <article class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
          <h4 class="font-semibold">2) Missionaries gain converts</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            They come quietly and gain trust from some villagers. Their presence challenges
            the clan’s religious, social, and political traditions. This brings major change.

          <h4 class="font-semibold">Proverbs</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Proverbs are a key part of Igbo tradition. They show shared wisdom and values.
            When new beliefs enter the village, this shared language starts to fade.

          <h4 class="font-semibold">Yams</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Yams symbolize tradition, masculinity, and success. They show how the clan values
            hard work and stability. As change comes, these values feel threatened.

        <article class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
          <h4 class="font-semibold">Locusts</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Locusts stand for the arrival of something that seems harmless at first but becomes
            destructive—like the coming of the colonizers.
